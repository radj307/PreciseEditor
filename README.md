<h1 style="text-align: center;">PRECISE EDITOR</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mod for Kerbal Space Program</h2>

### Compiled for KSP version 1.6.0

### Introduction
The KSP craft editor is an approximative tool where the part's position and angle are not displayed anywhere so we have to rely on primitive techniques like counting the number of grid snaps or placing parts "by eye". While this is the Kerbal spirit, this become annoying for the serious craft builder. So this mod is intended to remedy that and offer a more accurate alternative part placement method than mouse and gizmos. This might change your craft building experience !
